# IBQ Consumer Facing Classes

##### The Client Application for QuickQuote follows an Object Oriented Programming Paradigm, which works in conjunction with what is passed back from our API. For instance if you take a response from our API (response.json) you will see that the Models Object passes back Objects that contain the relevant Fields with Descriptions, Rules, and Data Types. Therefore, within our Application we have classes(classes.js) that follow the hierarchy Application -> Module -> Form -> Model -> Inline -> Field. Each Class invokes the child Class beneath it. So once the Client is handed back the Model object from the API, the Model class would then invokes its child the Field class, which handles the Rules and Regex for each field, the type of Input element needed to be appended to the DOM, and the label for the element.
